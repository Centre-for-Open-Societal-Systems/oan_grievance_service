"""Duplicate grievances: flagging a likely repeat, and the officer's ruling on it.

The system only flags. A new grievance is compared with the same submitter's earlier
grievances; a pair that scores at or above the threshold is recorded as a Grievance Duplicate
row awaiting review. Nothing about the ticket changes until an officer confirms it, which
moves it to the terminal Duplicate state and points it at the main ticket. An officer who
rules it is not a duplicate leaves the ticket exactly as it was.

The comparison is the "Option A" score of GRIEVANCE_SIMILARITY_ALGORITHMS.md, phase 1:

    score = w_description * description + w_category * same category + w_type * same type

The description is a cosine over character n-grams of the normalised text. Only one
submitter's tickets are ever compared (a handful, not millions), so there is no index and
no IDF weighting: the pool is too small for inverse document frequency to mean anything.
Category and type are weights, not filters, because submitters sometimes pick the wrong
one. The weights and thresholds are starting points an administrator tunes in Grievance
Settings from measurements on labelled pairs; the defaults live here until they are set.
